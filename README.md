The tutors of the Department of Enterprise and Digital Innovation at Ara Institute of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand are the industry clients of this project.

The purpose of this project has been to deploy a product that allows students in database courses in computer labs at Ara Institute of Canterbury to submit their SQL Server language code work and get automated marks and feedback instantly. This is important to the industry clients, the tutors of these databases classes at Ara, because by using this product they will be able to save many weeks not having to manually download all their students work to execute and manually mark and provide feedback, also their students will not have to wait many weeks to get their marks and feedback returned, therefore time is saved, and manual work is automated.
